# Exercise 11

print("How old are you?", end=' ')
age = input()
print("How tall are you?", end=' ')
height = input()
print("How much do you weight?", end=' ')
weight = input()

print(f"So, you're {age} years old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")

# We put a end=' ' at the end of each print line. This tells print to not end
# the line with a newline character and go to the next line.
